# Timeout functions

1. [setTimeout()](./setTimeout.js)
2. [setInterval()](./setInterval.js)

- `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` are part of WEB API, which means we call it as `window.setTimeout()`,
but actually, we can call it just like this `setTimeout()`, while we are in
the global scope
- `setTimeout()` happens only once
- `setInterval()` happens many times (until gets stopped)
