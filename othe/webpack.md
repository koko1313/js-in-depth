# Webpack

> Webpack is a build tool. But it's more than a build tool. It manages our code, but it's not limited to that.
> **Webpack** uses `babel` to transpile code

## Install webpack

Install webpack using `npm`
```
npm install webpack
```


## Webpack features

1. Manage the code
    For example if we include scripts in html file, we have to include them in specific order.  
    The same is with the style files.

2. Minify code for production
    Another Webpack functionality is that it minifies our code for production.

3. Provides us a development server
    ```
    npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
    ```
